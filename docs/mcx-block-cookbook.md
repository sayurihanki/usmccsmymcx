## Content Rules

- Shared storefront styling now follows the guided-selling conventions: dark-first surfaces, scoped custom properties on block roots, scarlet and gold token mapping, and tactical condensed and display typography.
- Keep rows to the declared shape. Do not add a fifth column.
- For `mcx-product-cards`, the fourth column is newline-delimited config: `category`, `flags`, `emoji`, `sizes`.
- For `mcx-product-cards`, the third column is newline-delimited pricing/rating config: `rating`, `reviews`, `price`, `original`, `chip`.
- For `mcx-hero`, `primary-cta` and `secondary-cta` should be authored as links in the value cell.
- For `mcx-hero`, `image` is the first slide and any additional carousel slides should be authored as `image-2`, `image-3`, and so on.
- For `mcx-hero`, do not author `status-badge-*` rows for new content. Older content can keep them safely until cleanup.
- For `mcx-hero-2`, `primary-cta` and `secondary-cta` should be authored as links in the value cell.
- For `mcx-hero-2`, each quick-link or intel slot should be authored as a complete matched row set. Partial groups are skipped.
- For `mcx-hero-2`, the ticker and benefits from the newcomer concept remain separate blocks, not bundled hero rows.
- For `mcx-product-cards`, do not author `tabs` or `default-tab` rows for new content. Older content can keep them safely until cleanup.
- For `mcx-category-grid`, `mcx-product-cards`, and `mcx-featured-collections`, section framing is handled by section metadata, not extra wrapper blocks.
- For `mcx-header` and `mcx-footer`, edit the fragments instead of the page body.
