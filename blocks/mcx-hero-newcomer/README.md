# MCX Hero Newcomer

## Overview

The `mcx-hero-newcomer` block is a newcomer-focused MCX hero variant. It keeps the tactical scarlet-and-gold visual language, but swaps the image carousel for an abstract command-surface layout with layered background motion, optional rank badges, quick links, right-side intel panels, two CTAs, and up to four stats.

| `heading-line-2` | Second headline line |
| `heading-line-3` | Third headline line |

Optional fields:

| Field Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |

| `quick-link-N-label` | Quick-link title for slot `N` (`1..4`) |
| `quick-link-N-href` | Quick-link destination for slot `N` |

| --- | --- |
| `clock`, `new`, `whats-new` | Clock / new arrivals |

## Rendering And Behavior

- The block adds `mcx-hero-newcomer-section` to the containing section for full-bleed MCX framing.
- On MCX block-library preview URLs, if `heading-line-1` is missing, the block falls back to built-in newcomer demo content.
- Quick-link rows only render when both the matching label and href exist.
- Intel cards only render when the matching `tag`, `value`, and `sub` rows all exist. Progress values are clamped to `0..100` and invalid values fall back to `0`.
- Stat rows only render when both the value and label exist. Values that begin with a number animate from zero while preserving suffixes like `%`, `+`, or `hr`. Non-numeric values such as `Tax Free` stay static.
- Decorative motion is reduced automatically when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled.

## Common Gotchas

- Author `primary-cta` and `secondary-cta` as real links, not plain text URLs.
- Keep each optional quick-link or intel slot complete. Partial groups are skipped.
- `quick-link-N-tone` accepts only `red`, `gold`, or `teal`. Anything else falls back to `red`.
- `mcx-hero-newcomer` does not bundle the ticker or benefits bar from the mockup. Compose those separately with `mcx-ticker` and `mcx-benefits`.
- This block does not support `image` or `image-2+` rows.
